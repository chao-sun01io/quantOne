# LOF arbitrage

## What is LOF?

LOF (Listed Open-ended Fund) is a unique investment vehicle in China that combines features of both open-ended mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. It allows investors to trade fund shares on the stock exchange while also offering direct subscription and redemption with the fund company.

## Key Features to Track

1. Premium/Discount to NAV (Net Asset Value)
2. liquidity:  Trading volume , fund size
3. Historical arbitrage opportunities
4. Subscription/Redemption Status
5. Cost of trade

## How does the premium and discount come?

As the fund is traded in two markets, chances are the on-floor price is higher or lower than the NAV. Premium/discount situations typically occur due to:

1. Subscription/Redemption Restrictions:
   - Complete suspension of subscription
   - Daily subscription quota limits
   - Minimum subscription amounts

2. Market Friction:
   - Trading hours differences (Some LOF hold the oversea assets)

3. Liquidity Factors:
   - Limited trading volume ()

These restrictions and market conditions create arbitrage opportunities when the on-floor trading price deviates significantly from the NAV. However, the ability to capture these opportunities depends on:

- Current subscription/redemption status
- Available quotas
- Transaction timing
- Cost considerations
